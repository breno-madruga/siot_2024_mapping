One commonly used technique to enhance the availability is live migration, which replicates services based on virtualization technology. However, continuous live migration with checkpointing will introduce significant overhead. In this paper, we present a lightweight live migration (LLM) mechanism to integrate whole-system migration and input replay efforts, which aims at reducing the overhead while providing comparable availability. LLM migrates service requests from network clients at high frequency during the interval of checkpointing system updates. Once a failure happens to the primary machine, the backup machine will continue the service based on the virtual machine image and network inputs at their respective last migration rounds. We implemented LLM based on Xen and compared it with Remus-a state-of-the-art effort that enhances the availability by checkpointing system status updates. Our experimental evaluations show that LLM clearly outperforms Remus in terms of network delay and overhead. For certain types of applications, LLM may also be a better alternative in terms of downtime than Remus. In addition, LLM achieves transaction level consistency like Remus.","[Jiang, Bo; Ravindran, Binoy] Virginia Tech, ECE Dept, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Kim, Changsoo] Electronics & Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea","({'id': '-7417583118199358712', 'affiliation': 'Electronics & Telecommunications Research Institute', 'country': 'South Korea'}, {'id': '1467035924664433380', 'affiliation': 'Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University', 'country': 'USA'})","23","4","SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN","0302-9743;1611-3349","2010-01-01","2010","","('hardware & architecture', 'computer science', 'theory & methods')","WOS:000289123400034","2010-1"

Recently a fast, lightweight migration mechanism (LLM) was proposed to reduce the long network delay in Remus. However, these virtualized systems have the long downtime problem, which is a bottleneck to achieve HA. Based on LLM, in this paper, we describe a fine-grained block identification (or FGBI) mechanism to reduce the downtime in virtualized systems so as to achieve HA, with support for a block sharing mechanism and hybrid compression method. We implement the FGBI mechanism and evaluate it against LLM and Remus, using several benchmarks such as Apache, SPECweb, NPB and SPECsys. Our experimental results reveal that FGBI reduces the type I downtime over LLM and Remus by as much as 77% and 45% respectively, and reduces the type II downtime by more than 90% and more than 70%, compared with LLM and Remus respectively. Moreover, in all cases, the performance overhead of FGBI is less than 13%.","[Lu, Peng; Ravindran, Binoy] Virginia Tech, ECE Dept, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Kim, Changsoo] Electronics & Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea","({'id': '-7417583118199358712', 'affiliation': 'Electronics & Telecommunications Research Institute', 'country': 'South Korea'}, {'id': '1467035924664433380', 'affiliation': 'Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University', 'country': 'USA'})","22","3","SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN","0302-9743;1611-3349","2011-01-01","2011","","('theory & methods', 'computer science')","WOS:000304129900005","2011-1"

The method is referred to as hybrid, as the subtractive structuring of metal sheets is combined with the additive joining of the sheets by adhesive bonding. This enables enclosed inner cavities without support structures, which are used to approximate the optimal density distribution from a topology optimization via manufacturing. The proposed LLM method is validated on the basis of a bearing block of a ball screw feed drive.

However, the agricultural industry has yet to fully integrate LLM into its practice due to the dominance of visual images in agricultural data that cannot be effectively processed by LLM designed for text. Additionally, traditional image classification networks have limitations in understanding crop etiology and disease, hindering accurate diagnosis. Furthermore, the mixture of diseases can also interfere with the network's prediction. Therefore, accurately analyzing pests and diseases in agricultural scenarios and providing diagnostic reports remains a challenge. To address this issue, a novel approach that combines the deep logical reasoning capabilities of GPT-4 with the visual understanding capabilities of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) network was proposed in this study. Additionally, a new lightweight variant of YOLO, called YOLOPC, and a novel image-to-text mapping method for adapting YOLO and GPT were introduced. The experimental results demonstrate that YOLOPC, with approximately 75% fewer parameters than YOLOv5-nano, achieves a 94.5% accuracy rate. The GPT induction and reasoning module demonstrates 90% reasoning accuracy in generating agricultural diagnostic reports with text assistance. In the future, it is likely that a higher-performance GPT model will be released. The combination of GPT with agricultural scenarios will become the cornerstone of large-scale agricultural diagnostic models.

It requires large-scale training datasets and high computational and storage resources. Moreover, DL techniques and machine learning (ML) approaches in general, hypothesize that training and testing data come from the same domain, with the same input feature space and data distribution characteristics. This assumption, however, is not applicable in some real-world artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Moreover, there are situations where gathering real data is challenging, expensive, or rarely occurring, which cannot meet the data requirements of DL models. deep transfer learning (DTL) has been introduced to overcome these issues, which helps develop high-performing models using real datasets that are small or slightly different but related to the training data. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of DTL-based ASR frameworks to shed light on the latest developments and helps academics and professionals understand current challenges. Specifically, after presenting the DTL background, a well-designed taxonomy is adopted to inform the state-of-the-art. A critical analysis is then conducted to identify the limitations and advantages of each framework.

In this study, we employed thermal analysis coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry to investigate the pyrolysis process. Representative FRP showed a starting decomposition temperature of 300 C and bisphenol A, styrene, alkenes, and phenols could be identified. The identified parameters were used to operate a pilot plant with a capacity of up to 50 kg/h FRP, and reactor products were directly analyzed with soft photoionization mass spectrometry. The findings demonstrated good agreement between the pilot plant results and laboratory experiments, particularly for smaller compounds (m/z<2 0 0). The non-condensable fraction showed a range of 17 to 22 MJ/m(3) as lower heating value. Analysis of the recovered fibers (diameter between 6.20 and 8.05 mu m) revealed residual coke, but no toxic fibers were detected, according to the World Health Organization's definition.

A toxicological assessment using a multicellular in vitro model confirmed the low hazardous potential of the recovered fibers. The findings contribute to developing sustainable and environmentally friendly recycling strategies for FRP while addressing important aspects related to the safety and toxicological implications of the resulting chemicals and fibers.","[Friederici, Lukas; Koch, Arne; Martens, Patrick; Pantzke, Jana; Di Bucchianico, Sebastiano; Streibel, Thorsten; Rueger, Christopher P.; Zimmermann, Ralf] Univ Rostock, Chair Analyt Chem, Joint Mass Spectrometry Ctr, D-18059 Rostock, Germany; [Friederici, Lukas; Di Bucchianico, Sebastiano; Rueger, Christopher P.; Zimmermann, Ralf] Univ Rostock, Dept Life Light & Matter LLM, D-18059 Rostock, Germany; [Pantzke, Jana; Di Bucchianico, Sebastiano; Streibel, Thorsten; Zimmermann, Ralf] Helmholtz Association, Cooperat Grp Comprehens Mol Analyt CMA, Joint Mass Spectrometry Ctr, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany","({'id': '7199387045434911458', 'affiliation': 'Helmholtz Association', 'country': 'Germany'}, {'id': '32816283256612759', 'affiliation': 'University Of Rostock', 'country': 'Germany'})","75","0","PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","0956-053X;1879-2456","2024-01-01","2024","10.1016/j.wasman.2023.11.002","('environmental engineering', 'environmental sciences & ecology', 'environmental sciences', 'engineering')","WOS:001115816700001","2024-1"

However, these approaches often require extra parameters & training, and generalize poorly to new dataset distributions. To mitigate this, we propose leveraging a recently developed constrained generation model Neurological Decoding (NLD) as an alternative to current QFS regimes which rely on additional sub-architectures and training. We first construct lexical constraints by identifying important tokens from the document using a lightweight gradient attribution model, then subsequently force the generated summary to satisfy these constraints by directly manipulating the final vocabulary likelihood. This lightweight approach requires no additional parameters or finetuning as it utilizes both an off-the-shelf neural retrieval model to construct the constraints and a standard generative language model to produce the QFS. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach on two public QFS collections achieving near parity with the state-of-the-art model with substantially reduced complexity.","[Xu, Zhichao] Univ Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Cohen, Daniel] Dataminr Inc, Nyc, NY USA","({'id': '8031492056520389162', 'affiliation': 'University Of Utah', 'country': 'USA'}, {'id': '63126814640623291', 'affiliation': 'Dataminr Inc', 'country': 'USA'})","36","0","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","","2023-01-01","2023","10.1145/3539618.3591936","('theory & methods', 'computer science', 'information systems')","WOS:001118084001078","2023-1"

This work comprehensively studied the efficacy of modern deep learning (DL) methods in forecasting traffic accidents and enhancing Level-4 and Level-5 (L-4 and L-5) driving assistants with actionable visual and language cues. Using a rich dataset detailing accident occurrences, we juxtaposed the Transformer model against traditional time series models like ARIMA and the more recent Prophet model. Additionally, through detailed analysis, we delved deep into feature importance using principal component analysis (PCA) loadings, uncovering key factors contributing to accidents. We introduce the idea of using real-time interventions with large language models (LLMs) in autonomous driving with the use of lightweight compact LLMs like LLaMA-2 and Zephyr-7b-alpha. Our exploration extends to the realm of multimodality, through the use of Large Language-and-Vision Assistant (LLaVA)-a bridge between visual and linguistic cues by means of a Visual Language Model (VLM)-in conjunction with deep probabilistic reasoning, enhancing the real-time responsiveness of autonomous driving systems. In this study, we elucidate the advantages of employing large multimodal models within DL and deep probabilistic programming for enhancing the performance and usability of time series forecasting and feature weight importance, particularly in a self-driving scenario.

However, such services will encounter high latency because of data transmission and a high volume of user requests. On the other hand, edge-cloud computing can provide adequate computation power and low latency at the same time through the collaboration between edges and the cloud. Thus, it is attractive to build GenAI systems at scale by leveraging the edge-cloud computing paradigm.

To achieve fast acquisition and memory-efficient reconstruction, the ViSTa-MRF sequence leverages an optimized 3D tiny-golden-angle-shuffling spiral-projection acquisition and joint spatial-temporal subspace reconstruction with optimized preconditioning algorithm. With the proposed ViSTa-MRF approach, high-fidelity direct MWF mapping was achieved without a need for multicompartment fitting that could introduce bias and/or noise from additional assumptions or priors.Results: The in vivo results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed acquisition and reconstruction framework to provide fast multi-parametric mapping with high SNR and good quality. The in vivo results of 1 mm- and 0.66 mm-isotropic resolution datasets indicate that the MWF values measured by the proposed method are consistent with standard ViSTa results that are 30x slower with lower SNR. Furthermore, we applied the proposed method to enable 5-min whole-brain 1 mm-iso assessment of MWF and T-1/T-2/PD mappings for infant brain development and for post-mortem brain samples.Conclusions: In this work, we have developed a 3D ViSTa-MRF technique that enables the acquisition of whole-brain MWF, quantitative T-1, T-2, and PD maps at 1 and 0.66 mm isotropic resolution in 5 and 15 min, respectively.

To maintain conceptual ambiguity and flexibility during the early stages of design development, specific and conventional sub-categories of transportation vehicles were gradually obscured, while prompts describing the new design framework and component attributes were introduced progressively. Expert evaluations were conducted by ten bicycle or motorcycle design practitioners, who assessed creativity and practical feasibility using Likert scales and qualitative assessments. ANOVA analysis revealed significant differences in prompt implementation and creativity among the three concept ideas. Qualitative evaluations highlighted several challenges, including difficulties in assessing creativity when framework errors occur, excessive divergence in AI-generated content without the guidance of a clear conventional frame, the challenge for designers to keep pace with the fast and high-quality development efficiency of the AI tool, and AI's limitations in judging feasibility and safety related to human factors. The study suggests the need for improved precision in prompt wording and enhancing the AI's understanding of transportation design terminology. Generative AI still faces challenges in effectively supporting innovative design practices, particularly in addressing new framework details, component conflicts, and understanding professional terminology.

Due to the significant differences in spatial resolution of remote sensing images, existing methods in this field have predominantly concentrated on the fine-grained extraction of remote sensing image features, but they cannot effectively handle the semantic consistency between visual features and textual features. To efficiently align the image-text, we propose a novel two-stage vision-language pre-training (VLP)-based approach to bootstrap interactive image-text alignment for RSIC, called BITA, which relies on the design of a lightweight interactive Fourier transformer (IFT) to better align remote sensing image-text features. The Fourier layer in the IFT is capable of extracting multiscale features of remote sensing images in the frequency domain, thereby reducing the redundancy of remote sensing visual features. Specifically, the first stage involves preliminary alignment through image-text contrastive learning (ITC), which aligns the learned multiscale remote sensing features from the IFT with textual features. In the second stage, the IFT connects the frozen image encoder with a large language model (LLM). Then, prefix causal language modeling (PCLM) is utilized to guide the text generation process using visual features. Ultimately, across the UCM-caption, RSICD, and NWPU-caption datasets, the experimental results clearly demonstrate that BITA outperforms other advanced comparative approaches.","[Yang, Cong; Li, Zuchao; Zhang, Lefei] Wuhan Univ, Natl Engn Res Ctr Multimedia Software, Sch Comp Sci, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Yang, Cong; Li, Zuchao; Zhang, Lefei] Hubei Luojia Lab, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China","({'id': '6072807733189830920', 'affiliation': 'Wuhan University', 'country': 'China'}, {'id': '5632473383925402132', 'affiliation': 'Hubei Luojia Lab', 'country': 'China'})","59","2","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","0196-2892;1558-0644","2024-01-01","2024","10.1109/TGRS.2024.3359316","('engineering', 'imaging science & photographic technology', 'electrical & electronic engineering', 'geochemistry & geophysics', 'remote sensing')","WOS:001173250800007","2024-1"

The aim is to retain the performance of the original model while substantially reducing computational requirements. However, traditional knowledge distillation methods may struggle to effectively transfer crucial explainable knowledge from an LLM teacher to the student, potentially leading to explanation inconsistencies and decreased performance. This paper presents DiXtill, a method based on a novel approach to distilling knowledge from LLMs into lightweight neural architectures. The main idea is to leverage local explanations provided by an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) method to guide the cross-architecture distillation of a teacher LLM into a self-explainable student, specifically a bi-directional LSTM network.Experimental results show that our XAI-driven distillation method allows the teacher explanations to be effectively transferred to the student, resulting in better agreement compared to classical distillation methods,thus enhancing the student interpretability. Furthermore, it enables the student to achieve comparable performance to the teacher LLM while also delivering a significantly higher compression ratio and speedup compared to other techniques such as post-training quantization and pruning, which paves the way for more efficient and sustainable edge AI applications","[Cantini, Riccardo; Orsino, Alessio; Talia, Domenico] Univ Calabria, Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy","({'id': '-3388401414440165261', 'affiliation': 'University Of Calabria', 'country': 'Italy'},)","41","0","SPRINGERNATURE","2196-1115","2024-05-04","2024","10.1186/s40537-024-00928-3","('theory & methods', 'computer science')","WOS:001214165900002","2024-5"

This has given rise to a range of issues, including fake news, academic fraud, phishing emails, posing significant dangers across various domains. However, current machine-generated text (MGT) detection methods still face challenges, including the need to access model's output logits or losses, which makes it unable to adapt to black-box scenarios in the real world, and difficult to deploy models with large parameter sizes. Therefore, we propose a compression-based lightweight network for MGT detection that leverages the ability of lossless compression to effectively extract features between categories. With fewer parameters, our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in MGT detection under black box conditions. Experiments demonstrate that our approach performs exceptionally well on both Chinese and English datasets. Specifically, our method achieves a full-text detection accuracy of 99.5%, surpassing the previous SOTA method.","[Zhou, Yinghan; Wen, Juan; Jia, Jianghao; Gao, Liting; Zhang, Ziwei] China Agr Univ, Coll Informat & Elect Engn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China","({'id': '-3736226594895697177', 'affiliation': 'China Agricultural University', 'country': 'China'},)","36","0","IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","1070-9908;1558-2361","2024-01-01","2024","10.1109/LSP.2024.3394264","('electrical & electronic engineering', 'engineering')","WOS:001216311200003","2024-1"

These arise notably from LLMs' reliance on vast datasets often laden with personal information, underscoring the potential for inadvertent memorization and disclosure of sensitive data. Addressing these pivotal privacy concerns, our research introduces a novel two -fold approach aimed at bolstering the confidentiality and security of user data in LLM applications. Firstly, we deploy advanced cryptographic techniques, incorporating bespoke encryption and hashing protocols, to preprocess user data. This strategy effectively anonymizes personal identifiers prior to their processing by LLMs, directly tackling the challenges of sensitive information exposure. Concurrently, our methodology encompasses a secure mutual authentication protocol utilizing lightweight cryptographic measures. This ensures that system interactions are strictly reserved for authenticated users, thereby enhancing overall data security. Collectively, our approach not only preserves the utility of data for AI tasks but also fortifies the privacy framework surrounding LLMs, significantly reducing the likelihood of privacy breaches and steering AI development towards a more secure and ethically grounded future.","[Gupta, Brij B.] Asia Univ, Int Ctr AI & Cyber Secur Res & Innovat CCRI, Taichung, Taiwan; [Gupta, Brij B.] Asia Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Taichung, Taiwan; [Gupta, Brij B.] Kyung Hee Univ, 26 Kyungheedae Ro, Seoul, South Korea; [Gupta, Brij B.] Symbiosis Int Univ, Symbiosis Ctr Informat Technol SCIT, Pune, India; [Gupta, Brij B.] Univ Petr & Energy Studies UPES, Ctr Interdisciplinary Res, Dehra Dun, India; [Gaurav, Akshat] Ronin Inst, Montclair, NJ USA; [Arya, Varsha] Asia Univ, Dept Business Adm, Taichung, Taiwan; [Arya, Varsha] Lebanese Amer Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Beirut 1102, Lebanon; [Alhalabi, Wadee] King Abdulaziz Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Immers Virtual Real Res Grp, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; [Alsalman, Dheyaaldin] Dar Al Hekma Univ, Sch Engn Comp & Informat, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; [Vijayakumar, P.] Univ Coll Engn Tindivanam, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Tindivanam 604001, Tamil Nadu, India","({'id': '-7686667451985913977', 'affiliation': 'University Of Petroleum & Energy Studies (Upes)', 'country': 'India'}, {'id': '3516267031115854501', 'affiliation': 'Dar Al Hekma University', 'country': 'Saudi Arabia'}, {'id': '4527970765769224187', 'affiliation': 'Symbiosis International University', 'country': 'India'}, {'id': '4851631967519761494', 'affiliation': 'Lebanese American University', 'country': 'Lebanon'}, {'id': '-3261419447107869652', 'affiliation': 'Asia University Taiwan', 'country': 'Taiwan'}, {'id': '8491626345152156016', 'affiliation': 'Kyung Hee University', 'country': 'South Korea'}, {'id': '7770930139697299451', 'affiliation': 'King Abdulaziz University', 'country': 'Saudi Arabia'}, {'id': '3062319981172853837', 'affiliation': 'Univ Coll Engn Tindivanam', 'country': 'India'}, {'id': '4979606163366783888', 'affiliation': 'Ronin Inst', 'country': 'USA'})","45","0","PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","0045-7906;1879-0755","2024-05-01","2024","10.1016/j.compeleceng.2024.109215","('engineering', 'electrical & electronic engineering', 'computer science', 'hardware & architecture', 'interdisciplinary applications')","WOS:001224093700001","2024-5"
