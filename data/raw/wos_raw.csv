The focus is on design creativity and practical feasibility. Six sets of prompts were used with Midjourney to generate lightweight two-wheeled vehicle concept ideas. To maintain conceptual ambiguity and flexibility during the early stages of design development, specific and conventional sub-categories of transportation vehicles were gradually obscured, while prompts describing the new design framework and component attributes were introduced progressively. Expert evaluations were conducted by ten bicycle or motorcycle design practitioners, who assessed creativity and practical feasibility using Likert scales and qualitative assessments. ANOVA analysis revealed significant differences in prompt implementation and creativity among the three concept ideas. Qualitative evaluations highlighted several challenges, including difficulties in assessing creativity when framework errors occur, excessive divergence in AI-generated content without the guidance of a clear conventional frame, the challenge for designers to keep pace with the fast and high-quality development efficiency of the AI tool, and AI's limitations in judging feasibility and safety related to human factors. The study suggests the need for improved precision in prompt wording and enhancing the AI's understanding of transportation design terminology. Generative AI still faces challenges in effectively supporting innovative design practices, particularly in addressing new framework details, component conflicts, and understanding professional terminology. Therefore, expert judgment and refinement remain crucial in the overall development phase. Furthermore, uncertainties persist concerning potential patent issues.","[Cheng, Shih-Hung] Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Taipei 106335, Taiwan",National Taiwan University of Science & Technology,"Cheng, SH (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Taipei 106335, Taiwan.",achille@mail.ntust.edu.tw,,,,,,,36,0,0,15,15,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-031-48056-0; 978-3-031-48057-7,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2023,14059,,,,,,39,57,,10.1007/978-3-031-48057-7_3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-48057-7_3,,,19,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BW5EW,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001159622900003,View Full Record in Web of Science

This work comprehensively studied the efficacy of modern deep learning (DL) methods in forecasting traffic accidents and enhancing Level-4 and Level-5 (L-4 and L-5) driving assistants with actionable visual and language cues. Using a rich dataset detailing accident occurrences, we juxtaposed the Transformer model against traditional time series models like ARIMA and the more recent Prophet model. Additionally, through detailed analysis, we delved deep into feature importance using principal component analysis (PCA) loadings, uncovering key factors contributing to accidents. We introduce the idea of using real-time interventions with large language models (LLMs) in autonomous driving with the use of lightweight compact LLMs like LLaMA-2 and Zephyr-7b-alpha. Our exploration extends to the realm of multimodality, through the use of Large Language-and-Vision Assistant (LLaVA)-a bridge between visual and linguistic cues by means of a Visual Language Model (VLM)-in conjunction with deep probabilistic reasoning, enhancing the real-time responsiveness of autonomous driving systems. In this study, we elucidate the advantages of employing large multimodal models within DL and deep probabilistic programming for enhancing the performance and usability of time series forecasting and feature weight importance, particularly in a self-driving scenario.

One commonly used technique to enhance the availability is live migration, which replicates services based on virtualization technology. However, continuous live migration with checkpointing will introduce significant overhead. In this paper, we present a lightweight live migration (LLM) mechanism to integrate whole-system migration and input replay efforts, which aims at reducing the overhead while providing comparable availability. LLM migrates service requests from network clients at high frequency during the interval of checkpointing system updates. Once a failure happens to the primary machine, the backup machine will continue the service based on the virtual machine image and network inputs at their respective last migration rounds. We implemented LLM based on Xen and compared it with Remus-a state-of-the-art effort that enhances the availability by checkpointing system status updates. Our experimental evaluations show that LLM clearly outperforms Remus in terms of network delay and overhead. For certain types of applications, LLM may also be a better alternative in terms of downtime than Remus. In addition, LLM achieves transaction level consistency like Remus.","[Jiang, Bo; Ravindran, Binoy] Virginia Tech, ECE Dept, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Kim, Changsoo] ETRI, Daejeon, South Korea",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; Electronics & Telecommunications Research Institute - Korea (ETRI),"Jiang, B (corresponding author), Virginia Tech, ECE Dept, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",bjiang@vt.edu; binoy@vt.edu; cskim7@etri.re.kr,"Jiang, Bo/E-2046-2013; Ravindran, Binoy/C-6016-2017","Ravindran, Binoy/0000-0002-8663-739X",,,,,23,4,5,0,3,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-642-16022-6,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2010,6366,,,,,,420,+,,,,,,3,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BUF43,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000289123400034,View Full Record in Web of Science

Based on LLM, in this paper, we describe a fine-grained block identification (or FGBI) mechanism to reduce the downtime in virtualized systems so as to achieve HA, with support for a block sharing mechanism and hybrid compression method. We implement the FGBI mechanism and evaluate it against LLM and Remus, using several benchmarks such as Apache, SPECweb, NPB and SPECsys. Our experimental results reveal that FGBI reduces the type I downtime over LLM and Remus by as much as 77% and 45% respectively, and reduces the type II downtime by more than 90% and more than 70%, compared with LLM and Remus respectively.

Current QFS approaches typically involve injecting additional information, e.g. query-answer relevance or fine-grained token-level interaction between a query and document, into a finetuned large language model. However, these approaches often require extra parameters & training, and generalize poorly to new dataset distributions. To mitigate this, we propose leveraging a recently developed constrained generation model Neurological Decoding (NLD) as an alternative to current QFS regimes which rely on additional sub-architectures and training. We first construct lexical constraints by identifying important tokens from the document using a lightweight gradient attribution model, then subsequently force the generated summary to satisfy these constraints by directly manipulating the final vocabulary likelihood. This lightweight approach requires no additional parameters or finetuning as it utilizes both an off-the-shelf neural retrieval model to construct the constraints and a standard generative language model to produce the QFS. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach on two public QFS collections achieving near parity with the state-of-the-art model with substantially reduced complexity.","[Xu, Zhichao] Univ Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Cohen, Daniel] Dataminr Inc, Nyc, NY USA",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Xu, ZC (corresponding author), Univ Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",zhichao.xu@utah.edu; daniel.cohen@dataminr.com,"Xu, Zhichao/V-2231-2017","Xu, Zhichao/0000-0002-2370-4487",,,,,36,0,0,1,1,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-4503-9408-6,,,,2023,,,,,,,1745,1749,,10.1145/3539618.3591936,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3539618.3591936,,,5,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BW2LG,,"hybrid, Green Submitted",,,2024-06-07,WOS:001118084001078,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the agricultural industry has yet to fully integrate LLM into its practice due to the dominance of visual images in agricultural data that cannot be effectively processed by LLM designed for text. Additionally, traditional image classification networks have limitations in understanding crop etiology and disease, hindering accurate diagnosis. Furthermore, the mixture of diseases can also interfere with the network's prediction. Therefore, accurately analyzing pests and diseases in agricultural scenarios and providing diagnostic reports remains a challenge. To address this issue, a novel approach that combines the deep logical reasoning capabilities of GPT-4 with the visual understanding capabilities of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) network was proposed in this study. Additionally, a new lightweight variant of YOLO, called YOLOPC, and a novel image-to-text mapping method for adapting YOLO and GPT were introduced. The experimental results demonstrate that YOLOPC, with approximately 75% fewer parameters than YOLOv5-nano, achieves a 94.5% accuracy rate. The GPT induction and reasoning module demonstrates 90% reasoning accuracy in generating agricultural diagnostic reports with text assistance. In the future, it is likely that a higher-performance GPT model will be released.

We begin by filtering out likely irrelevant information with a lightweight logistic regression model before passing the more challenging inputs to the transformer-based model. We evaluate our approach using CUAD, a legal dataset with 510 manually-annotated, long contracts.

For machine tool parts, they enable the reduction of moving masses and therefore increase the resource and energy efficiency of production systems. However, this usually results in complex part structures that are difficult or impossible to produce using conventional manufacturing methods. In this paper, a hybrid layer laminated manufacturing (LLM) method is proposed enabling manufacturing of topology-optimized machine tool parts. The method is referred to as hybrid, as the subtractive structuring of metal sheets is combined with the additive joining of the sheets by adhesive bonding. This enables enclosed inner cavities without support structures, which are used to approximate the optimal density distribution from a topology optimization via manufacturing. The proposed LLM method is validated on the basis of a bearing block of a ball screw feed drive. A experimental study in the time and frequency domain on a test rig confirms the principle suitability of the LLM method for the production of industrial applicable lightweight components.","[Helfesrieder, Nico; Neubauer, Michael; Lechler, Armin; Verl, Alexander] Univ Stuttgart, Inst Control Engn Machine Tools & Mfg Units ISW, Seidenstr 36, D-70174 Stuttgart, Germany",University of Stuttgart,"Helfesrieder, N (corresponding author), Univ Stuttgart, Inst Control Engn Machine Tools & Mfg Units ISW, Seidenstr 36, D-70174 Stuttgart, Germany.",nico.helfesrieder@isw.uni-stuttgart.de,,"Neubauer, Michael/0000-0002-6336-6283; Verl, Alexander/0000-0002-2548-6620; Helfesrieder, Nico/0000-0002-8209-8181",,,,,27,0,0,0,7,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-6524,1863-7353,,PROD ENG-RES DEV,Prod.

Due to the significant differences in spatial resolution of remote sensing images, existing methods in this field have predominantly concentrated on the fine-grained extraction of remote sensing image features, but they cannot effectively handle the semantic consistency between visual features and textual features. To efficiently align the image-text, we propose a novel two-stage vision-language pre-training (VLP)-based approach to bootstrap interactive image-text alignment for RSIC, called BITA, which relies on the design of a lightweight interactive Fourier transformer (IFT) to better align remote sensing image-text features. The Fourier layer in the IFT is capable of extracting multiscale features of remote sensing images in the frequency domain, thereby reducing the redundancy of remote sensing visual features. Specifically, the first stage involves preliminary alignment through image-text contrastive learning (ITC), which aligns the learned multiscale remote sensing features from the IFT with textual features. In the second stage, the IFT connects the frozen image encoder with a large language model (LLM). Then, prefix causal language modeling (PCLM) is utilized to guide the text generation process using visual features. Ultimately, across the UCM-caption, RSICD, and NWPU-caption datasets, the experimental results clearly demonstrate that BITA outperforms other advanced comparative approaches.","[Yang, Cong; Li, Zuchao; Zhang, Lefei] Wuhan Univ, Natl Engn Res Ctr Multimedia Software, Sch Comp Sci, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Yang, Cong; Li, Zuchao; Zhang, Lefei] Hubei Luojia Lab, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China",Wuhan University,"Zhang, LF (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Natl Engn Res Ctr Multimedia Software, Sch Comp Sci, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China.",yangcong356@whu.edu.cn; zcli-charlie@whu.edu.cn; zhanglefei@whu.edu.cn,,,,,,,59,2,2,7,7,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0196-2892,1558-0644,,IEEE T GEOSCI REMOTE,IEEE Trans.

The rapid development of GenAI systems has created a huge amount of new data on the Internet, posing new challenges to current computing and communication frameworks. Currently, GenAI services rely on the traditional cloud computing framework due to the need for large computation resources. However, such services will encounter high latency because of data transmission and a high volume of user requests. On the other hand, edge-cloud computing can provide adequate computation power and low latency at the same time through the collaboration between edges and the cloud. Thus, it is attractive to build GenAI systems at scale by leveraging the edge-cloud computing paradigm. In this overview paper, we review recent developments in GenAI and edge-cloud computing, respectively.

To address this issue, Knowledge Distillation approaches have been adopted to transfer knowledge from a complex model, referred to as the teacher, to a more compact, computationally efficient one, known as the student. The aim is to retain the performance of the original model while substantially reducing computational requirements. However, traditional knowledge distillation methods may struggle to effectively transfer crucial explainable knowledge from an LLM teacher to the student, potentially leading to explanation inconsistencies and decreased performance. This paper presents DiXtill, a method based on a novel approach to distilling knowledge from LLMs into lightweight neural architectures. The main idea is to leverage local explanations provided by an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) method to guide the cross-architecture distillation of a teacher LLM into a self-explainable student, specifically a bi-directional LSTM network.Experimental results show that our XAI-driven distillation method allows the teacher explanations to be effectively transferred to the student, resulting in better agreement compared to classical distillation methods,thus enhancing the student interpretability. Furthermore, it enables the student to achieve comparable performance to the teacher LLM while also delivering a significantly higher compression ratio and speedup compared to other techniques such as post-training quantization and pruning, which paves the way for more efficient and sustainable edge AI applications","[Cantini, Riccardo; Orsino, Alessio; Talia, Domenico] Univ Calabria, Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy",University of Calabria,"Cantini, R (corresponding author), Univ Calabria, Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy.",rcantini@dimes.unical.it,,,,,,,41,0,0,3,3,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,2196-1115,,J BIG DATA-GER,J.

Moreover, DL techniques and machine learning (ML) approaches in general, hypothesize that training and testing data come from the same domain, with the same input feature space and data distribution characteristics. This assumption, however, is not applicable in some real-world artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Moreover, there are situations where gathering real data is challenging, expensive, or rarely occurring, which cannot meet the data requirements of DL models. deep transfer learning (DTL) has been introduced to overcome these issues, which helps develop high-performing models using real datasets that are small or slightly different but related to the training data. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of DTL-based ASR frameworks to shed light on the latest developments and helps academics and professionals understand current challenges. Specifically, after presenting the DTL background, a well-designed taxonomy is adopted to inform the state-of-the-art. A critical analysis is then conducted to identify the limitations and advantages of each framework. Moving on, a comparative study is introduced to highlight the current challenges before deriving opportunities for future research.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

To achieve fast acquisition and memory-efficient reconstruction, the ViSTa-MRF sequence leverages an optimized 3D tiny-golden-angle-shuffling spiral-projection acquisition and joint spatial-temporal subspace reconstruction with optimized preconditioning algorithm. With the proposed ViSTa-MRF approach, high-fidelity direct MWF mapping was achieved without a need for multicompartment fitting that could introduce bias and/or noise from additional assumptions or priors.Results: The in vivo results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed acquisition and reconstruction framework to provide fast multi-parametric mapping with high SNR and good quality. The in vivo results of 1 mm- and 0.66 mm-isotropic resolution datasets indicate that the MWF values measured by the proposed method are consistent with standard ViSTa results that are 30x slower with lower SNR. Furthermore, we applied the proposed method to enable 5-min whole-brain 1 mm-iso assessment of MWF and T-1/T-2/PD mappings for infant brain development and for post-mortem brain samples.Conclusions: In this work, we have developed a 3D ViSTa-MRF technique that enables the acquisition of whole-brain MWF, quantitative T-1, T-2, and PD maps at 1 and 0.66 mm isotropic resolution in 5 and 15 min, respectively. This advancement allows for quantitative investigations of myelination changes in the brain.","[Cao, Xiaozhi] Room 301, Packard Elect Engn Bldg, 350 Jane Stanfo, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Liao, Congyu; Cao, Xiaozhi; Iyer, Siddharth Srinivasan; Schauman, Sophie; Zhou, Zihan; Chen, Quan; Li, Zhitao; Wang, Nan; Setsompop, Kawin] Stanford Univ, Dept Radiol, Stanford, CA USA; [Liao, Congyu; Cao, Xiaozhi; Schauman, Sophie; Chen, Quan; Wang, Nan; Kerr, Adam; Setsompop, Kawin] Stanford Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Stanford, CA USA; [Iyer, Siddharth Srinivasan] MIT, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Cambridge, MA USA; [Zhou, Zihan; He, Hongjian; Zhong, Jianhui] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Biomed Engn & Instrument Sci, Ctr Brain Imaging Sci & Technol, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Yan, Xiaoqian; Grill-Spector, Kalanit] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychol, Stanford, CA USA; [Yan, Xiaoqian] Fudan Univ, Inst Sci & Technol Brain Inspired Intelligence, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Gong, Ting] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Athinoula A Martinos Ctr Biomed Imaging, Boston, MA USA; [Gong, Ting] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA USA; [Wu, Zhe] Univ Hlth Network, Techna Inst, Toronto, ON, Canada; [He, Hongjian] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Phys, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Zhong, Jianhui] Univ Rochester, Dept Imaging Sci, Rochester, NY USA; [Yang, Yang] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Radiol & Biomed Imaging, San Francisco, CA USA; [Kerr, Adam] Stanford Univ, Stanford Ctr Cognit & Neurobiol Imaging, Stanford, CA USA",Stanford University; Stanford University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Zhejiang University; Stanford University; Fudan University; Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; University of Toronto; University Health Network Toronto; Zhejiang University; University of Rochester; University of California System; University of California San Francisco; Stanford University,"Cao, XZ (corresponding author), Room 301, Packard Elect Engn Bldg, 350 Jane Stanfo, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",xiaozhic@stanford.edu,"Wen, Jing/KCL-6614-2024; wang, yifang/KEI-3766-2024; Chen, GuanYu/KGK-6328-2024; Setsompop, Kawin/P-1464-2014; chen, yue/JXW-9556-2024; Li, Zhitao/AAM-2867-2021; Liu, Zhe/KEJ-5299-2024","Setsompop, Kawin/0000-0003-0455-7634; Iyer, Siddharth/0000-0002-6432-0850; Schauman, Sophie/0000-0002-3744-2553; Gong, Ting/0000-0002-1378-8509; Grill-Spector, Kalanit/0000-0002-5404-9606; Cao, Xiaozhi/0000-0001-5095-648X; Li, Zhitao/0000-0003-3462-6549",,,,,76,0,0,5,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0740-3194,1522-2594,,MAGN RESON MED,Magn.

These materials find applications in various fields. However, the exceptional properties and diverse compositional range of FRPs pose challenges to conventional recycling strategies. Pyrolysis has emerged as a highly promising approach for separating the fibers from the polymer matrix. In this study, we employed thermal analysis coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry to investigate the pyrolysis process. Representative FRP showed a starting decomposition temperature of 300 C and bisphenol A, styrene, alkenes, and phenols could be identified. The identified parameters were used to operate a pilot plant with a capacity of up to 50 kg/h FRP, and reactor products were directly analyzed with soft photoionization mass spectrometry. The findings demonstrated good agreement between the pilot plant results and laboratory experiments, particularly for smaller compounds (m/z<2 0 0). The non-condensable fraction showed a range of 17 to 22 MJ/m(3) as lower heating value. Analysis of the recovered fibers (diameter between 6.20 and 8.05 mu m) revealed residual coke, but no toxic fibers were detected, according to the World Health Organization's definition. Yet, the organic coating of the fibers contained small amounts of potentially harmful PAHs. A toxicological assessment using a multicellular in vitro model confirmed the low hazardous potential of the recovered fibers. The findings contribute to developing sustainable and environmentally friendly recycling strategies for FRP while addressing important aspects related to the safety and toxicological implications of the resulting chemicals and fibers.","[Friederici, Lukas; Koch, Arne; Martens, Patrick; Pantzke, Jana; Di Bucchianico, Sebastiano; Streibel, Thorsten; Rueger, Christopher P.; Zimmermann, Ralf] Univ Rostock, Chair Analyt Chem, Joint Mass Spectrometry Ctr, D-18059 Rostock, Germany; [Friederici, Lukas; Di Bucchianico, Sebastiano; Rueger, Christopher P.; Zimmermann, Ralf] Univ Rostock, Dept Life Light & Matter LLM, D-18059 Rostock, Germany; [Pantzke, Jana; Di Bucchianico, Sebastiano; Streibel, Thorsten; Zimmermann, Ralf] Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Cooperat Grp Comprehens Mol Analyt CMA, Joint Mass Spectrometry Ctr, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany",University of Rostock; University of Rostock; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health,"Rüger, CP (corresponding author), Univ Rostock, Chair Analyt Chem, Joint Mass Spectrometry Ctr, D-18059 Rostock, Germany.",,"; Di Bucchianico, Sebastiano/AHI-8150-2022","Martens, Patrick/0000-0002-5719-872X; Di Bucchianico, Sebastiano/0000-0002-6396-892X",,,,,75,0,0,6,7,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0956-053X,1879-2456,,WASTE MANAGE,Waste Manage.,JAN 1,2024,173,,,,,,10,21,,10.1016/j.wasman.2023.11.002,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2023.11.002,,NOV 2023,12,"Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,AA8F6,37951038,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001115816700001,View Full Record in Web of Science
